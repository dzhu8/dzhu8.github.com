excerpt: 'With the world effectively gridlocked by COVID-19, I began a months-long exploration into the world of epidemiology and multivariate modeling. We aimed to predict immune response features that correlated with vaccine-induced protection against COVID-19, finding evidence of a critical role for non-neutralizing antibodies in this process.'
