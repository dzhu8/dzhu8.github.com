excerpt: 'I worked on this project as an undergrad, and this paper was the culmination of a collaboration with Dr. Zach Geisterfer. The microtubule cytoskeleton plays critically important roles in numerous cellular functions in eukaryotes, and it does so across a functionally diverse and morphologically disparate range of cell types. Thus, the cytoskeleton must scale and change in accordance with cell size, geometry and function. Despite this variance in size and shape, microtubules assemble to steady state in mass, suggesting some negative feedback that limits the extent of assembly. Here, we used microscopy and computational modeling to reveal a significant negative correlation between microtubule plus-end density and microtubule growth rates.'
