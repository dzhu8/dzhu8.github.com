excerpt: 'From both a technological and intellectual perspective, this has been my most complex paper (and certainly the one that has taken the most time and effort!). We developed a suite of tools for spatiotemporal analysis at the embryo-scale, leveraging emergent spatial transcriptomics platforms to provide the data. Our tools enable study of spatial distribution and inference of cell-cell communication in 3D, and we used them to study the molecular characteristics of embryonic development using a mouse model. To this end, we generated a complete 3D molecular hologram of the mouse embryo at E9.5 and E11.5, with whole-transcriptome profiled at single-cell resolution covering nearly 9 million total cells- the first of its kind.'
