excerpt: 'The protective immunity induced by vaccination is generally diminished in immunocompromised individuals. At the time of publication, it was uncertain the degree to which mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 would be able to protect immunocompromised individuals against the Delta variant. Our analysis suggested that vaccine boosting (i.e. a third dose) would be necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised populations.'
