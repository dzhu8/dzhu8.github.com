Education
======
* Ph.D in Biological Engineering, MIT, 2026 (expected)
* B.S.EE. in Electrical Engineering w/ Honors, University of Wyoming, 2020
* B.S. in Molecular Biology w/ Honors, University of Wyoming, 2020

Work experience
======
* Fall 2020-now: Graduate Student Researcher @ MIT
  * Developed computational toolbox for transfer learning, imputation, spatially variable gene identification, cell-cell communication prediction and gene regulation prediction to analyze single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data
  * Analysis of transcriptomic and serological data in the context of cancer, COVID-19 and mammalian embryogenesis
  * Cross-species translation of clinical insights from transcriptomics data using autoencoder framework	

* Spring 2019-Spring 2020: Undergraduate Researcher and INBRE Fellow @ University of Wyoming
  * Confocal microscopy, photolithography, microfluidics and timelapse image processing to study cytoskeletal dynamics
