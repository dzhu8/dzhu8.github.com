This page is a window into both my professional and personal life- feel free to reach out via any of the contact links; I'm happy to chat about anything!

Biology
======
I am a molecular biologist studying the spatiotemporal characteristics of cells at the [Whitehead Institute](https://wi.mit.edu/) & [MIT](https://be.mit.edu/), with a focus on predicting the characteristics and consequences of interacting molecular components.

Computation
======
I develop analytical computational platforms (see the [Spateo package](https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release)). I am also a hobby programmer always eager to learn more about what we can do with machines. I have recently ventured into developing atomistic protein modeling tools and language modeling (see the Portfolio page for examples!)
