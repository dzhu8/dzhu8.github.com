Hello and welcome to the blog! I'm Daniel, and I'm thrilled to share a bit of my world with you. I'm a PhD candidate in Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I study cell-cell communication and develop predictive models to predict the spatiotemporal variability that occurs as a result of these varied interactions. I hold dual Bachelor's degrees in Molecular Biology and Electrical Engineering from the University of Wyoming.

I initially became interested in the concept of bioengineering early in my freshman year of college, being drawn to the promise of designing things to supplement what nature has already provided. However, it would not be until grad school that I would truly appreciate what bioengineering is and could be.  

What Am I Going to be Blogging About? 
======
The posts that will go here will primarily cover new biotechnologies and biotech companies, interspersed with more introspective pieces that derive from my own interpretations of my experiences. By writing about these things, my hope is that I can reinforce my understanding of new topics, by doing deeper research than I probably would otherwise. At some point, there may be some example data science projects or other learning resources that can be followed along. I'm a big proponent of experiential learning and want to share resources to help with that! 


Let's Connect &#129309;
